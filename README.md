# Data Privacy
This repo contains a set of programs written for the University of Vermont course [*Data Privacy*](https://github.com/jnear/cs295-data-privacy). The programs work on a variety of topics from [*k-anonimity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) to [*differential privacy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) with machine learning. The data used by these programs is from the US census, with synthetic personally-identifiable information (name, date of birth, social-security numbers, and zip-codes).
